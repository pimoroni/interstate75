"""
This example lets you display an animated gif, by cycling quickly through a series of PNG images.

First resize your gif to 128x128 pixels (we used https://ezgif.com/resize for this).

Then use https://ezgif.com/split (and 'Output images in PNG format') to split the gif into individual frames.

Save the individual frames in a folder on your I75 called "gif" (or change the folder name in the code below).

Check out https://1jps.tumblr.com/ for many nice retro video game gifs!
